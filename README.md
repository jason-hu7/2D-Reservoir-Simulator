# 2D-Reservoir-Simulator
2D 2Phase Oil-gas reservoir simulator

Instructions for Jason Hu's reservoir simulator:

Main body of the function:
Phase_4_case1.m for case 1
Phase_4_case2.m for case 2
Phase_4_case3.m
Phase_4_case4.m
Phase_4_case4_2.m

Simulation input for the simulator:
simulation_input.m	for case 1
simulation_input_2.m	for case 2
simulation_input_3.m
simulation_input_4.m
simulation_input_4_2.m

Auto-timestepping is implemented to increase the speed of simulation.
Convergence criteria can be modified to respond to different situations.

To run case 1, just go to Phase_4_case1.m and click run
Run time is usually between 10 to 15 seconds. Convergence criteria is described in the report.

To run case 2, do the same with case 1
Run time is usually between 10 to 15 seconds.

To run case 3, just go to Phase_4_case3.m and click run
default grid size is 69 x 69, to change the gridding, go to simulation_input_3.m to change the setting under grid section and well section.
Run time is usually around 5 minutes.

To run case 4, go to Phase_4_case4.m and click run for case 4.1, and Phase_4_case4_2.m and click run for case 4.2
